Differences between Document and Window Objects:

1: Window manages browser interactions
 
  Document acts as an interface for content manipulation. 

2:The window object, supported by all browsers, represents the browser’s window

  The Document object is the HTML document that appears in the browser window and 
  serves as an interface for interacting with the web page’s content

3:The Window object is responsible for managing global variables, functions,
 and objects, providing methods for browser interaction

 With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page

4:A document is an object inside the window object

 The first thing that gets loaded into the browser is the window 

5:we use a document object for manipulation inside the document

the properties related to that window are stored in the window object
